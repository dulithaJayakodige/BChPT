In terms of the $\zeta$ power counting linking the low-energy and 1/Nc expansions according to O($\zeta$)=O(p)=O(1/Nc), the study is carried out to next-to-next-to-leading order, and it includes SU(3) breaking corrections to the |$\Delta$S|=1 vector charges, charge radii, and magnetic moments and radii. The results are obtained for generic Nc, allowing for investigating the various scalings in Nc.},

	abstract = {Baryon masses at varying values of Nc and light quark masses are studied with lattice QCD and the results are analyzed in a low-energy effective theory based on a combined framework of the 1/Nc and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory expansions. Lattice QCD results for Nc=3, 5 and 7 obtained in quenched calculations, as well as results for unquenched calculations for Nc=3, are used for the analysis. The results are consistent with a previous analysis of Nc=3 lattice QCD results, and in addition permit the determination of subleading in 1/Nc effects in the spin-flavor singlet component of the baryon masses, as well as in the hyperfine splittings. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

@article{Cordon2013,
	abstract = {The effective theory for baryons with combined 1/Nc and chiral expansions is analyzed for nonstrange baryons. Results for baryon masses and axial couplings are obtained in the small scale expansion, to be coined as the $\xi$ expansion, in which the 1/Nc and the low energy power countings are linked according to 1/Nc=O($\xi$)=O(p). Masses and axial couplings are analyzed to O($\xi$3) and O($\xi$2), respectively, which correspond to next-to-next to leading order evaluations, and require one-loop contributions in the effective theory. The spin-flavor approximate symmetry, a consequence of the large Nc limit in baryons, plays a very important role in the real world with Nc=3 as shown by the analysis of its breaking in the masses and the axial couplings. Applications to the recent lattice QCD results on baryon masses and the nucleon's axial coupling are presented. It is shown that those results are naturally described within the effective theory at the order considered in the $\xi$ expansion. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},
